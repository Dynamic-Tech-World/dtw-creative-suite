## 🧠 Engineering Deep-Dive

### 1. Client-Side Image Processing (Binary Logic)
The **Image Compressor** and **Convertor** tools utilize the `File` and `Blob` APIs to process images directly in the browser memory. By leveraging `HTML5 Canvas` for re-rendering and quality adjustment, we achieve significant file-size reduction without any data leaving the user's machine.

### 2. Dynamic Template Engines
The **GitHub Readme Generator** utilizes a structured state-management system to handle user input and inject it into complex Markdown templates. This ensures a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) experience with real-time preview updates.

### 3. Typography & Unicode Mapping
The **Fancy Font Generator** goes beyond simple CSS styles; it implements custom Unicode mapping logic to transform standard character sets into stylized mathematical alphanumeric symbols, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

### 4. Interactive DOM Manipulation
The **Advance Image Puzzle** showcases complex DOM-to-Canvas interactions, where source images are sliced into coordinate-mapped fragments and managed via a custom drag-and-drop state engine.
